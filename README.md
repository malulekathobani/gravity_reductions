A more precise elevation determination is then needed to compute more precise gravity anomalies with minimal errors. The new method of applying gravity correction / reduction using a Digital Elevation Model is superior to traditional methods in that it is highly accurate (minimal interpolation errors), labour-saving and more flexible by providing data for inaccessible locations (Banerjee and Paramesh, 1998).
The Gravity Anomalies precision assessment is evaluated over Bushveld Complex in South Africa using 100 GPS/levelling, 1-arc-second Shuttle Radara Topography Mission (SRTM) DEM and Topographic Interpolated elevation data (1:50 000 South African topographical maps). Then the SRTM elevations/heights are to be used for 8040 Gravity Points Reduction to obtain precise gravity anomalies (Free-air anomaly, Simple Bouguer and Complete Bouguer anomaly).
